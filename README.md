# CS7-Deep-Learning-for-Image-Fusion
This project enhances the fusion of infrared (IR) and visible images using deep learning models like GANs and diffusion techniques. Traditional methods like wavelet transforms and PCA are implemented for benchmarking, while advanced methods significantly improve image quality and speed. A key focus is real-time deployment on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano.
